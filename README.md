# CalamiTeacher

Android Application for SKYHack 2018. Built in React Native.

# Aim 

The aim was to build a narrative based approach towards disaster education and accessing the API built for the disaster response of the hackathon theme.

The application wasn't completely able to represent the narrative idea but could be easily extended to create a more interactive approach.
